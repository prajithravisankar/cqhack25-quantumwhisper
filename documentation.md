# Project Documentation

## Summary of Completed Sub-todos from Roadmap

### **1.1.1 Create React Application**
- Initialized a React app using Vite.
- Installed dependencies and verified the app runs successfully.
- Removed unnecessary boilerplate files.

### **1.1.2 Install Core Dependencies**
- Installed the following:
  - `ggwave` for audio processing.
  - `crypto-js` for cryptographic utilities.
  - `tailwindcss`, `postcss`, and `autoprefixer` for styling.
  - `react-audio-visualize` for audio visualization.

### **1.1.3 Configure Tailwind CSS**
- Manually created `tailwind.config.js` and `postcss.config.js` due to `npx` issues.
- Configured Tailwind content paths and added directives to `src/index.css`.
- Verified Tailwind classes work.

### **1.1.4 Set Up Project Structure**
- Created directories for `components`, `utils`, `hooks`, and `context`.
- Initialized empty component files with basic exports.
- Set up absolute imports in `vite.config.js`.

### **1.2.1 Configure Development Environment**
- **Browser Developer Tools**: Enabled audio debugging and tested Web Audio API availability.
- **HTTPS Configuration**:
  - Generated self-signed certificates (`key.pem` and `cert.pem`) using OpenSSL.
  - Configured Vite dev server to use HTTPS.
  - Trusted the self-signed certificate in the browser.
- **Error Boundary**: Added an `ErrorBoundary` component to catch development errors.

## Notes on Certificates
- **Purpose**: Self-signed certificates are used to enable HTTPS for local development (required for microphone access).
- **Files**: `key.pem` and `cert.pem`.
- **Security**: These files are added to `.gitignore` to prevent them from being committed to the repository.
- **Regeneration**: Other developers can generate their own certificates using:
  ```bash
  openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout key.pem -out cert.pem -days 365 -nodes
  ```
