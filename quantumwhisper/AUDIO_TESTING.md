# QuantumWhisper Audio Testing Guide

## Latest Fixes Applied

✅ **Fixed GGWave API Issue**: Removed incorrect `.init()` call that doesn't exist in GGWave 0.4.0  
✅ **Enhanced Error Handling**: Multiple fallback layers with clear console logging  
✅ **Improved User Feedback**: Alert messages when fallbacks are used  
✅ **Auto-diagnostics**: App tests GGWave on startup and logs results  

## Current Status

The app now has **3-layer fallback system**:
1. **GGWave audio transmission** (primary method)
2. **Simple tone audio** (when GGWave fails) 
3. **Clipboard copy/paste** (when all audio fails)

## Testing Steps

### 1. Check Console on App Load
1. Open browser DevTools console
2. Refresh the page
3. Look for GGWave diagnostic messages:
   - ✅ "GGWave loaded successfully" = good to go
   - ❌ "GGWave initialization failed" = will use fallbacks

### 2. Test Audio System
1. Click "Test Audio" button - should hear 1-second tone
2. If no sound: check browser volume and audio permissions

### 3. Transmit Key (with fallbacks)
1. Generate a quantum key
2. Click "Transmit Key via Audio"
3. Watch console for detailed progress:
   - "Attempting GGWave transmission..."
   - If fails: "Using audio fallback..." (listen for 8 beeps)
   - If that fails: "Using clipboard fallback..." (auto-copied)

### 4. Manual Transfer Method
1. Click "Copy Payload" button (always works)
2. Go to receiver, click "Paste Payload"
3. Should show successful key reception

## Console Messages to Watch For

**Good signs:**
- ✅ GGWave loaded successfully
- ✅ GGWave encode test successful
- ✅ Audio fallback completed
- ✅ Key payload copied to clipboard as fallback

**Issues:**
- ❌ GGWave initialization failed
- ❌ GGWave encode test failed  
- ❌ All fallbacks failed

## Browser Requirements

- Modern browser with Web Audio API
- Audio output device (speakers/headphones)
- Clipboard permissions for fallback method

## Expected Behavior

**Best case**: GGWave works, you hear encoded audio data  
**Normal case**: GGWave fails, you hear 8 beeps representing key bits  
**Fallback case**: All audio fails, payload auto-copied to clipboard with alert

The system is designed to **always work** even if audio completely fails!
